# Anime-Quiz
This quiz will test your anime knowledge!

## Description
This timed quiz serves as an intense exercise with vanilla js functionalities. Be warned!


- My main motivation for this style of challenge was the practice use of timers and local storage with JS.

- It took the course of about 3 days and really studying to see the flow in building something like this. I can't wait to play with jQuery and Bootstrap though!

- In reality , I feel like this solved my need to understand JS more.

- I learned that styling something like this from scratch is definitely going to take me more practice. Cant wait!
